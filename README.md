<h1><b>
LeaderboardList App
</b></h1>
<a name="about-project"></a>
<p>
In this activity I will set up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. I will develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling - just functionality. In the following activities (milestone 2 and 3), I will consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and add some styling. </p> <br/>
<p>
The leaderboard website displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved thanks to the external Leaderboard API service. </p><hr>
